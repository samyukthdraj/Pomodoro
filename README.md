# Pomodoro
This project is to make our work productivity more efficient. How this works is that we'll start the timer, work for 25 mins the timer will stop and give a 5 mins break, this will continue until every 8th lap will give us 20 mins break. We'll be able to reset the timer by clicking the reset button. We'll be able to track how many laps of 25 mins work we did by the checkmarks we see, each checkmark will represent each lap.
